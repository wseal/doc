- Different Countries Have Different Kinds of Englishes

  Voyages of people from England play an import part in Speading the English language. At present,
  English is frequently spoken as an official or common language in many countries, such as American,
  Singapore, Malaysia and some African countries. All based on British English, the English spoken in
  these countries can be well understood by native English speakers. But actually, these English have
  been gradually changing in accents, spellings, expressions and the usage of vocabulary.

  Because of this fact, you can make use of the differences to tell which country the foreiners of your
  block are from. For example, if a boss fluently commands his driver, "Come up straight to my apartment
  by elevator and take some gas for my trucks and cabs" instead of requesing, "please, come to my flat by
  lift and take some petrol for my lorries and taxis", you can recognize his American identity, while the
  letter suggests that his is British.
