- 5 Let's Use a Rock  
  What do you do with the rocks you find?
  You probably throw them into a pond or leave them on the ground. Today, rocks are not
  very useful to us. But a long time ago they are very important.
  People long ago made tools withs rocks. We call tools made of rock stone tools.
  Lots of tools can be made useing rocks:hammers, bowls and even knives.
  People made knives by hitting two rocks together untils one was flat and sharp.
  Hunters used rocks too. Long ago people hunted with bows and arrows.These arrows
  had a sharp rock at tip(the end).Rocks were used as arrowheads. Without rocks, it would
  have been much harder for people to hunt animal.
  Rocks are alse used to create art. Have you ever seen a stone statue before?
  Stone statues of famous people are all over the world. Using a hammer and chisel, you can
  make a rock look like a person.

  What else can we make with rocks? We can make stone walls, houses and lots of other thins
  Try to think of some more on your own.

  It's not easy to be an astronaut. Sally knew it would be hard work. She had many weeks of
  training. During training, Sally learned about the space shuttle. She also learned what to do during the flight into space.

  At last Sally finished her training and was ready. She flew on the space shuttle Challenger. While in space , she helped put out satellites. These machines go around the

  because of this. But all Sally cares about is that her dream came true.

- Different Countries Have Different Kinds of Englishes

  Voyages of people from England play an import part in Speading the English language. At present,
  English is frequently spoken as an official or common language in many countries, such as American,
  Singapore, Malaysia and some African countries. All based on British English, the English spoken in
  these countries can be well understood by native English speakers. But actually, these English have
  been gradually changing in accents, spellings, expressions and the usage of vocabulary.

  Because of this fact, you can make use of the differences to tell which country the foreiners of your
  block are from. For example, if a boss fluently commands his driver, "Come up straight to my apartment
  by elevator and take some gas for my trucks and cabs" instead of requesing, "please, come to my flat by
  lift and take some petrol for my lorries and taxis", you can recognize his American identity, while the
  letter suggests that his is British.

- My First Band

```
I was very sensitive to music. Just dipping into the music books briefly, I could sing or play well. To be honest,
I always dreamt of becoming a famous folk actor. I was so confident that i never decreased my devotion.

I formed my first bank called "Rolling Frog". At the beginning, we relied on performing on instrument in pubs or
passer-by to earn extra money in cash. Then we wore false beards to pretend to be the musicians whom people were
farmiliar with. In addition, we attached humorous acts to our performances and played jokes on each other. soon
our funny jazz became famous and invitations to perform for broadcast stations began to come. Afterwards, we sorted
out attractive music and make a record in a studio. A million or so copies were sold and we became millionaires.

It was painful that the band broke up finally. But above all I realized my dream to be a musician.

  Dirty water rose in wells and canals before the earthquake. But no one judged that an earthquake was coming.
  Suddenly, everything shook. It seems as if the world was at the end. Millions of brick houses and a number of
  dams were destroyed. Railway tracks became useless bars. Pips in mines burst and let out smelly steam. Huge cracks
  trapped cyclists everywhere.

  The next day, this event was the headling or main title of all newspapers.

  With the reporters giving an outline of the disaster, the whole nation was shocked by the damage and the victim's
  extreme suffering. People were moved when they read that the survivors comforted each other by saying "Congratulations!
  YOu survived!", So they not only expressed their sympathy sincerely, but also organized together to help the victims
  right away. The injured were rescued and the dead were buried. The frightened survivors were dug out from under the
  ruins and were offered shelter, fresh water and electricity. Thanks to people's help, the loss was minimized.

    A wooden vase from the Ming Dynasty at the entrance of the reception hall amazed everyone. The artists designed it in
  a rare style and selected valuable jewels to decorate it. People thought highly of its fancy colour of honey and the
  beautiful paintings on it.

    The vase used to belong to a former castle. But when the country was at war, the enemy tropps exploded the castle. Debates
  on how the vase survived went on and on. In order to remove people's doubt, a team of no less than 20 people carried out an
  informal investigation. The evidences they found showed that a maid took the vase apart and asked a sailor to sink it in a
  local well. She never gave away the secret even under the cruel trial of the enemies who were in search of treasures.

- A Fair Competition

```
  Swifter, Higher and Stronger stands for the spirit of the Olympics. But fairness is the basic of this motto. Only when you
win fairly will you and your homeland deserve the great glory. But nowadays, unlike the ancient honest slave competitors,
some hopeless athletes who can't bear the pain of training cheat when taking part in games. Medals seem to have magical power
causing them to cheat, and the prize money has replaced the motto as their only goal.

  So, in the gymnastics event to be held in our city next month, one of the host's responsibilities is to keep competitions fair.
They advertised on posters outside the statium to promise that every competitor is to have a regular physical examination in a
gymnasium one after another. No noe can bargain on this. The volunteers in charge will be very strict. It is foolish to cheat
because they will not be admitted to compete and will even be fined as well

- Computers

  ```
    The goal of early calculating machines was to simplify difficult sums. But with the help of
  new technology, electronic chips replaced tubes and a revolution of artificial intelligence has
  arisen. From then on, the appearance of computers totally changed our lives. Then can not only
  download information from the net when connected by the network or mobile phone singles, but alse
  solve different types of logical problems. With operators as their coaches, they can even control
  rockets to explore the moon and instruct androids with the human race's characters to mop floor
  and watch over your naughty niece. Anyhow, computers are so helpful that they do bring happiness.

    However, computers are easily attacked by viruses. This reality has became a hard-to-deal with
  problem. As a result, computers are dangerous in a way. So personally, I worry about their universal
  application in some fields, such as finance.

- Wildlife Protection

```
  Dinosaurs died out because of an unexpected incident. But wildlife today disappears or is in danger just because humans do harm to it.
For example, tigers are hunted for fur to make carpets so that they can only live in secure reserves, grassland is destroyed without mercy
so that dust storms come into being affecting distant cities.

  Last year, scientists saw some monkeys rubbing themselves with a certain kind of insects to protect themselves from firece mosquitoes biting.
According to the result of the inspection, they found that the insect contains a powerful drup, so local farmers were employed to catch the
insects. The ending was that the insects disappeared from the whole zone. When told that is was a loss to humans, the farmers burst into laughter
and responded, "Our real loss is our decreasing income".

  We should appreciate the natural balance and pay more attention to the importance of wildlife protection. Not until we succed in letting wildlife
live in peace can we smile in relief.

## A Interesting Festival

```
  The Agricultural Feast takes place after the Independence Day. It's not a world celebration. Only Christians
in Mexico look forward to it's arrival for it's religious origin.

  Long ago, human's ancestors were bad. They fooled and played tricks on each other and never kept thier word.
So God turned up and drowned all their crops. Human's starved day and night weeping. In order to gain God's
forgiveness, a woman poet set off to see God. She admired God and kept apologizing. God was moved. With his
permission, humans finally had good harvests again. So to wipe sadness and remind themselves of the belief in
God, people began the festival.

On the festival, people gather in open air, such as playgrounds or parking lots, and energetically have fun with
each other all night long, as though they were never tired. When a beauty dressed up in lovely clothing reads
poems in memory of the poet, everyone holds their breath. Then, it is the custom that the bone of a rooster
head is given to her as an award.
